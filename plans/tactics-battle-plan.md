# Tactical Battle Feature Plan

- **Status:** In Progress

## Overview

Create a Final Fantasy Tactics-inspired overhead tactical combat prototype demonstrating grid rendering, unit placement, and turn sequencing.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Battlefield Rendering
- Render a configurable tile grid from an overhead perspective.
- Display friendly and enemy units with clear differentiation.
- Support keyboard navigation across the battlefield.

### Phase 2: Interaction and Commands
- Provide cursor selection and context-sensitive command prompts.
- Implement movement preview and confirmation flows.
- Resolve simple combat actions with hit point tracking and unit removal.
- Track global time units per turn and allow actions to consume multiple units to enable pacing mechanics.

### Phase 3: AI and Scenario Expansion
- [x] Add initiative-based AI turns with basic decision-making.
- [x] Script example scenarios with victory/defeat conditions.
- [ ] Introduce varied terrain types affecting movement.
- [x] Establish a state machine to orchestrate battle, menu, and pause scenes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Players can visually parse an overhead tactical grid populated with units.
- Units occupy discrete tiles and obey turn order logic.
- The system is structured for future expansion with AI and additional mechanics.

## Phase Completion Tracking

- [x] Phase 1 tasks initiated with foundational grid, unit, and turn modules.
- [x] Phase 2 tasks implemented with selectable units, movement ranges, and combat resolution.
- [ ] Phase 3 tasks implemented (AI and scenario scripting complete, terrain work pending).
