# Technical Considerations

## Love2D Module Structure
- Logic that must be unit tested is implemented in pure Lua modules (e.g., grid and turn management) so that it can be required without the Love runtime.

## Testing Strategy
- Custom lightweight Lua test harness ensures unit coverage without external dependencies.
- Tests set up package paths for project modules to allow running with the standard Lua interpreter.

## CI Preview Builds
- The love.js runtime is now produced from the maintained npm package on every build, keeping compatibility aligned with LÃ–VE 11.5 without committing large binaries.
- Preview HTML is generated from Lua to keep configuration colocated with the rest of the codebase and enable automated tests to validate template changes.
- Build artifacts should retain the original `game.love` archive for reproducibility and manual debugging when issues surface in the browser runtime.
- GitHub Actions dependencies (checkout, artifact upload, etc.) must track the latest supported major versions to avoid sudden workflow failures due to deprecations.
- Node.js is provisioned during CI so the `npx love.js -c` compatibility build remains reproducible across GitHub runners.
- GitHub Pages deployments are handled via `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and `actions/deploy-pages` so reviewers can launch the preview without downloading the artifact; the deploy job is skipped for forked pull requests where the token lacks write access.
- The HTML loader must call `Love(Module)` once the runtime script finishes downloading; without the explicit invocation GitHub Pages serves an inert canvas even though `love.js` downloads successfully. The start button now disables itself while fetching, updates the loader message, and restores the default label with an error when initialization fails so reviewers can retry.
- The loader now streams the compatibility runtime before requesting the compiled `game.js` bundle, surfacing distinct status updates and failure paths so reviewers never see a silent blank canvas when either download fails.
- Keep the preview canvas element's id set to `canvas`. The compatibility runtime resolves event targets with `document.querySelector('#canvas')`, so renaming the element causes pointer and keyboard listeners to fail with `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')` when `Love(Module)` initializes.
- A manifest file (`ci_preview/game_manifest.lua`) drives preview builds. `ci_preview/detect_changed_games.lua` diff the branch, maps changed files to manifest entries, and produces a Lua plan so `ci_preview/build_previews.lua` can package each `.love` archive before invoking `npx --yes love.js -c`. The launcher index is generated by `ci_preview/generate_preview_index.lua` so reviewers can switch games without editing URLs.
- When GitHub's cache service began returning HTTP 400 responses to `leafo/gh-actions-lua@v9`, disabling the build cache input on v11 restored reliable installs without materially impacting job duration.
- The Lua installer action may create a workspace-level `.lua` directory; lint discovery scripts must restrict results to regular files and explicitly skip the directory contents so `luac` does not attempt to parse them.
- GitHub runners may expose `luac` under versioned names (e.g., `luac5.1`); the preview workflow now resolves the compiler path dynamically before linting so syntax checks continue to run even when the unversioned shim is absent.
- The compiler detector runs as a POSIX shell script, removing the need for a Lua interpreter when linting environments only expose `luac` binaries.
- To stabilize linting on fresh GitHub runners, the workflow installs `lua5.1` explicitly so `luac` is guaranteed to exist while still allowing overrides via the `LUAC_EXECUTABLE` environment variable when custom compilers are needed.
- Lua 5.4 returns boolean success values from `os.execute`; the preview builder normalises the result so both boolean success and numeric zero are treated as successful commands while bubbling precise exit codes on failure.

## Rendering Constraints
- Battlefield rendering relies on Love2D's immediate mode drawing; separation of concerns keeps drawing isolated from game state logic.

## Tactical Battle Mechanics
- BattleSystem module centralizes rules for movement, actions, and outcome evaluation to enable deterministic unit tests.
- Movement range is computed with a breadth-first search over the grid while treating occupied tiles as obstacles.
- Combat resolution removes defeated units from both the battlefield and initiative order to maintain consistent turn flow.
- EnemyAI module evaluates reachable tiles, prioritising closer proximity to opposing units, and selects the lowest HP target when attacking to keep behaviour deterministic for testing.
- Combat resolution now factors defender orientation into critical hit odds, and the battle system exposes an injectable RNG so unit tests can remain deterministic.
- TurnManager exposes the ordered initiative list so that the HUD can display the active and upcoming units without mutating the underlying sequence.
- Scenario definitions live in standalone Lua tables that expose hooks and victory/defeat evaluators; shared scenario state is passed into BattleSystem contexts so scripted objectives and HUD updates can be exercised in unit tests without Love2D.
- Turn resolution aggregates per-action time costs, advancing a global time unit counter so scenarios can throttle expensive abilities or trigger hooks after specific durations.
- Movement commands build tile-by-tile paths that the battle state tweens through during `love.update(dt)`, separating deterministic grid logic from presentation.
- The `BattleFlowStateMachine` monitors player phases; `BattleState` forwards action completions and animation callbacks so turn summaries and automatic endings stay synchronised with rendered movement.
- Action availability is surfaced to the UI through state-machine callbacks, letting the battle scene drive a context menu that sequences move/attack decisions before orientation while tests exercise the same deterministic flow.

## Networking
- HTTP access is abstracted behind `lib/http_client.lua`, which exposes a `fetch` interface that proxies to synchronous `https`
  requests on desktop builds and the asynchronous `fetch.lua` bridge under love.js. Callers must provide callbacks when the
  transport reports `uses_fetch()` to avoid runtime assertions and should treat responses uniformly as `{ status, body, headers }`
  tuples.

## State Management
- A lightweight `Game` module coordinates named states, ensuring `enter`, `exit`, `update`, and `render` lifecycles remain isolated per scene.
- States receive the game context so they can share assets (fonts, configuration) without resorting to globals, easing future additions like pause or world map scenes.
- Unit tests stub the Love2D API to validate state transitions and battle scene initialization without requiring the engine runtime.
- Narrative states (start menu, world map, cutscenes) compose via callbacks rather than globals so campaign flow can react to battle outcomes while staying testable.
- World map data is stored in plain Lua tables and mirrored into the shared context, enabling persistence between state transitions without serialisation.
- The developer menu normalises upstream API failures into structured error messages; rendering treats those entries specially so issues are visible without inspecting logs.
- Love.js builds do not ship the native `https` module, so the developer menu proxies API calls through the bundled asynchronous `fetch.lua` helper when running on the web; callers must pump `love.fetch.update` during `love.update` to complete in-flight requests.

## World Navigation
- World maps describe connections as simple graphs; the map module runs a breadth-first search to produce the shortest path between destinations.
- Active travel serialises its remaining path so battles or cutscenes can interrupt the journey and resume it on return to the map state.
- Locations flag mandatory stops to require player interaction, while optional towns are automatically passed unless chosen as the destination.
