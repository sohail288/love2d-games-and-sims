# Technical Considerations

## Love2D Module Structure
- Logic that must be unit tested is implemented in pure Lua modules (e.g., grid and turn management) so that it can be required without the Love runtime.

## Testing Strategy
- Custom lightweight Lua test harness ensures unit coverage without external dependencies.
- Tests set up package paths for project modules to allow running with the standard Lua interpreter.

## Rendering Constraints
- Battlefield rendering relies on Love2D's immediate mode drawing; separation of concerns keeps drawing isolated from game state logic.
